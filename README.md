# Indexed Reversible Transformation (IRT)

This is a simple javascript demo for IRT.

demo : http://szha246.github.com/Indexed-Reversible-Transformation/

For a given string, IRT transfers it with FM mapping rule, like BWT does. 

But differently, IRT supports deletion and insertion of string under transfered format.

The demo is a simple example of transfering, deleting, and insertion.
